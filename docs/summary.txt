📊 Project Summary: Real-Time Energy Data Pipeline
🎯 What You Built:
A production-grade, automated energy data pipeline that monitors Turkey's electricity grid in real-time, transforming raw API data into actionable business intelligence through live dashboards.

🏗️ Technical Architecture:
⚙️ Core Components:
1. Data Ingestion & ETL:

Real-time API integration with Electricity Maps
Automated hourly data extraction (power generation, carbon intensity)
Smart data transformation with pandas (energy mix calculations, carbon levels)
Intelligent upsert logic (prevents duplicates, updates changed data)
2. Database Architecture:

MongoDB: Primary NoSQL database for flexible energy data storage
PostgreSQL: Optimized for Grafana analytics with time-series indexing
Automated sync pipeline between databases for performance optimization
3. Business Intelligence:

Live Grafana dashboards showing renewable vs fossil energy mix
Carbon footprint monitoring with environmental impact metrics
Time-series analysis of Turkey's grid performance
Real-time KPIs for energy efficiency tracking
4. Production Engineering:

Dockerized microservices architecture with multi-container deployment
Automated scheduling with error handling and logging
Database optimization with proper indexing and connection pooling
Environment-specific configurations for dev/staging/production
📈 Business Value:
Energy Trading: Real-time grid data for market decisions
Sustainability Reporting: Carbon footprint tracking for ESG compliance
Policy Analysis: Government energy transition monitoring
Grid Optimization: Renewable energy efficiency insights
